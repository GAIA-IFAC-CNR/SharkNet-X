# SharkNet-X
An Explainable Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Fossil Shark Tooth Identification

The files "VGG16-DA180_8Luglio24.h5 2.7z.001", "VGG16-DA180_8Luglio24.h5 2.7z.002" and "VGG16-DA180_8Luglio24.h5 2.7z.002" must be dowloaded together and decompressed in order to obtain the model.

This model refers to the VGG16 architecture trained with transfer learning and using data augmentation with rotation angles up to 180 degree.
